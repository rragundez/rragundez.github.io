Building a face recognition system with OpenCV

Description
In this tutorial we will create a face recognition application from scratch, it will provide you hands-on experience on the basics of Face Recognition. We will use the OpenCV library which makes the tutorial accessible to beginners. Together, we'll go from building our face dataset to recognizing faces in a live video. If time permits we will use this face recognition system to classify banking da

Abstract
Building a live face recognition system in the blink of a very slow eye

In this hands-on tutorial we will build a live face recognition system from scratch with the use of the OpenCV methods. Since face recognition is the main goal of this tutorial we will form teams of 2-3 people and recognize the faces in a live feed. We will make use of the OpenCV computer vision and machine learning library. OpenCV includes a comprehensive set of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can be used to:

Detect Faces
Recognize Faces
Identify Objects
Classify human actions in videos
Track camera movement
Track moving objects

Extract 3D models of objects
Produce 3D point clouds from stereo cameras
Stitch images together to produce a high resolution image of an entire scene
Find similar images from an image database
Remove red eyes from images taken using flash
Follow eye movements
OpenCV is a great tool to have in hand when dealing with data problems related to media. In the case you want to create your own tuned algorithm, due to its simplicity it lets you use the majority of your resources on developing the algorithm itself and not on the manipulation of the data, which can be a pain in the … .

OpenCV is not limited to Python but has C++, C, Java and MATLAB interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Android and Mac OS.
