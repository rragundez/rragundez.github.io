Timeline: yes


NSPIRE is a mobile application available for download which makes recommendations about what to do in your leisure time. I joined the project since almost the beginning and I was responsible for building the artificial intelligence part of it. Some of my responsibilities were:

- Advise on decisions about the application and technologies used.
- Work closely with an editorial office to fine-tuning the AI system.
- Implement several recommendation models.
- Taking the AI part of the application all the way from development to production.
- Supervise several data scientist during the time of the project.
- Share knowledge and communicate with internal data scientists such that they could take up the project after I leave.
