Summary: As a consultant from GoDataDriven working as a data scientist for Bakkersland.
Timeline: yes

I worked as the data scientist optimizing an existing shelf-replenisher prediction system for shops across The Netherlands, such system is used in production to maximize profit and minimize waste. I also developed a customer predictive algorithm to use as an input to improve the shelf-replenisher predictions. In addition I migrated all scheduled jobs to Airflow, and helped built a dashboard to monitor the model performance in production.
