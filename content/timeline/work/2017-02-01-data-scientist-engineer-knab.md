Timeline: yes

I worked in the insurance department building and productionizing a ranking algorithm. This model matches the best insurances to the customer needs and characteristics. I wrapped the model in an API to make it accessible to a future application in production, this implies continuous integration and automation of ETL processes. As a second project I built and automated ETL and cross-reference process that required encryption due to security measures. Both projects were used to provide a solution in production.
