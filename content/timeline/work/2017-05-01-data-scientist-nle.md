Summary: As a consultant from GoDataDriven working as a data scientist for the Dutch energy company (Nederlandse Energie Maatschappij).
Timeline: yes

In this project I was responsible for adding a model to an existing Spark pipeline. This model assigns customer conversion probabilities to different price offering strategies. The type of model does not exist in Spark, therefore a customized implementation was built which could integrate seemingly to the already existing SparkML pipeline.
