Summary: As a consultant from GoDataDriven working as a senior data scientist for Unilever.
Timeline: yes

Rodrigo worked developing a fuzzy name matching algorithm for entity
data of all countries within the Unilever market. Data coming from
different sources has been unavoidably duplicated. The goal was to create
golden records which will be enriched from all matching ones. This is a
known problem since already with 1 million records yields a cartesian
product of 10^12 comparisons, which is unfeasible. By vectorizing the
names, Rodrigo has built a Machine Learning approach which yield a
run-time of 1.5hrs for ~10 million records across 50 countries.
