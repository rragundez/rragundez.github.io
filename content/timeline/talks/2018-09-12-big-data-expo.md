DEEP LEARNING, THE ENGINE OF THE AI REVOLUTION

We all remember the boom of Internet companies in the late 90s, then in the late 2000s mobile companies took center stage and have been dominating ever since. A new type is taken the spotlight, this is the era of AI companies, and like it has been before there are two options: adapt or fade away.

In order to adapt is very important to understand the basic concepts that underpinned Artificial Intelligence and grasp how Deep Learning became the catalyzer of the AI tech revolution.
I’ll take you through a series of explanations with a historical overview of Deep Learning, and shine some light over question like: what’s the difference with classical Machine Learning? What can it do? What can’t it do? Why should my business care?
I’ll give you concrete examples of revolutionary AI that have converge into products in the areas of  health care, drug discovery, Fin Tech, medicine, supply chain, marketing, recruiting, customer experience and e-commerce.

Finally, I’ll communicate my opinion on how the development of an AI feature, AI application or AI business should flow and give my advice on how you create something of value under the shadow of the AI giants like Google, Microsoft, Apple etc.
