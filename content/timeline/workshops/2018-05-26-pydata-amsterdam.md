Abstract
Deep Learning has already conquered areas such as image recognition, NLP, voice recognition, and is a must-know tool for every Data Practitioner. This tutorial for aspiring Deep Learners will consist of a quick blunt Deep Learning overview followed by a hands-on tutorial that will teach you how to get started using Keras and Tesorflow.

This tutorial is for people that
know the fundamentals of machine learning
have a worked with the PyData stack
have no deep learning hands-on experience with Keras
Curriculum
Deep Learning landscape
Deep Learning tools in Python
Blunt review of the Keras API (Hands-on)
Build a deep learning model for an easy image classification dataset (Hands-on)
Play around and optimize deep learning model for a harder dataset (Hands-on)
Prerequisites
Experience with Python and jupyter notebooks
Keras or Tensroflow (version >= 1.4) installed
Note: Some of the material is a repeat of the Code Breakfast Deep Learning session of January 17, 2018
