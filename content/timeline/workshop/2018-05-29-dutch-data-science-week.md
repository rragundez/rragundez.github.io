Deep learning Special with Python, Tensorflow and Keras with a focus on Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTMs.
Every theory part is complemented by a hands-on session, the goal is that you become familiar with the theory but also learn the how to apply the theory in practice with several exercises.


Curriculum
Deep Learning basics (Theory)

Keras API with image classification (Hands-on)

Neural networks in practice (Theory)

Predicting bank term deposits (Hands-on)

Recurrent Neural Networks (Theory)

Forecasting airline passengers with RNNs (Hands-on)

Long short-term memory (Theory)

Human activity recognition with LSTMs (Hands-on)

NLP sentiment classification with LSTMs (Hands-on)

Introduction to Gated recurrent units (Theory)

Q&A

Some of the things you will learn are:
The Keras API

Pragmatic best practices when using Deep Learning models

Recognize cases when Recurrent Neural Networks are useful

Pre-process time-series data for an RNN or LSTM

Combine several time-series for a single RNN or LSTM model

Use many-to-one RNN and LSTM models

Use many-to-many RNN and LSTM models

Process text data for an RNN or LSTM model

Prerequisites
Experience in Python is advised for the hands-on sessions

Experience with Machine Learning concepts (e.g. regularization, overfitting, feature scaling, hyperparameter optimization)

Basic familiarity with Deep Learning

Activities
The course is dynamic with ideas exchanging and open communication. There are also some fun activities based on the course content.

Instructor
The workshop will be given by Rodrigo Agundez. Data Maverick at GoDataDriven. Rodrigo has been giving training sessions and workshops for several years now, he gave a Deep Learning Tensorflow workshop during the Data Science Summit Europe 2016 in Israel, is one of the current trainers for the Data Science with Python, the time-series lecture and Deep Learning training (GoDataDriven).

In addition, as a consultant, he has seen many use cases and can help you with specific questions that relate to using Data Science in practice, productizing models, etc.
